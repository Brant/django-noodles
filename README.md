Django Noodles
==============
Noodles is an app containing all sorts of misc. bits of code that I see to use across projects.

There aren't really any connecting dots or common design patterns. It's just stuff I use.

First, add noodles to your installed apps:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'noodles',
)
```
The pieces that noodles offers are explained in the (Documentation)[http://brant.github.io/django-noodles/]
